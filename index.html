            <h2>DRIVING SIMULATOR</h2>
            <h3>RWTH ISAC</h3>
            <h3>2022-2025</h3>
            <p>
            This is the beginning of my professional coding experience and I've had to tackle some serious problems to meet the requirements of
            the researchers, who conceptualized the studies for the simulator. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My first task was to improve the dynamics of traffic vehicles, making their behaviour 
            more physically accurate. I also optimized the vehicle rendering logic, significantly
            boosting performance by prioritizing the display of the most relevant cars among hundreds of simulated ones. 
            Later, I integrated a Bluetooth heart-rate sensor that logs data to a database alongside numerous behavioural metrics from study participants.
            I was also responsible for implementing scenario logic for the two most recent simulator studies — the first of which was published in October 2025.

            </p>
            <p>
            Some of my smaller contributions included modelling local department vehicles, designing a new animated 
            tachometer graphic for the simulator, and rendering short video clips for online forms.
            </p>
            <p>
            Most recently, I’ve been developing an Arduino-based prototype
            for a new e-scooter simulator, transmitting physical sensor data via serial connection to Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, I have prepared a short trailer for the simulator showcasing the physical setup and a selection of entertaining clips I have made over the years.
            </p>

            <h2>OFFICE GAME PROTOTYPE</h2>
            <h3>2025-2026?</h3>
            <p>
            This is the latest game I've started prototyping and is the first one I actually intend on finishing.
            While seemingly mundane at first there are a lot of fun features and many lines of code working behind the scenes to make everything run smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
            Initially I knew I wanted to have a desk, covered with stacks of paper, but after around a hundred sheets,
            the performance started to drop significantly. To fix that, I created container models that convey the feeling of giant paper stack without the performance hit.
            At the moment there are seven container sizes and the game dynamically chooses which ones to use to minimize the object count, 
            similar to a shop clerk choosing the right coins to give as change.
            </p>
            <div class="section-horizontal"><img src="images/stack.webp"/></div>
            <p>
            The game can also generate a randomized grid of any size. Depending on the difficulty a certain
            percentage of the grid can include requirement zones for the player to fill in. These zones check for edge collisions when generating
            to prevent overlap in the final layout.
            </p>
            <div class="section-horizontal"><img src="images/lattice.webp"/></div>
            <p>
            No office is complete without a bit of procrastination, so to replicate that experience, I added
            a procedural social media generator. It is loosely modeled after platforms such as Instagram or TikTok and allows for infinite scrolling,
            requiring custom code to get the smooth anchored-scrolling feel, which is iconic for the platforms. The displayed content is randomized,
            pulling from different sentence templates and word lists to create semi-coherent memes (which are arguably
            better than some 2025 memes).
            </p>
            <div class="section-horizontal"><img src="images/mems.webp"/></div>
            <p>
            Finally there are some meaningless interactables to round out the experience. When I looked at the nested structure of my scene,
            it reminded me of the six pivots of a Rubik's Cube, so I wanted to see if I could 
            recreate this legendary toy using said parent-child relationships. There’s nothing too complex code-wise, but it’s something fun to click.

            <h2>THIS WEBSITE</h2>
            <p>
            I wanted to expand my expertise and challenge myself with something new, so I built this small page over a couple of days with three goals in mind:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Showcase my projects</li>
                <li>Create a dynamic and polished site</li>
                <li>Prove I can adapt to any coding language</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            This page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a few more complex features, 
            such as dynamically highlighting the active navigation button and changing the background as the reader scrolls. 
            I also worked to make it largely immune to scaling issues when resizing the window, ensuring it functions well across all reasonable aspect ratios.

            <h2>UNRELATED DESIGN PROJECTS</h2>
            <p>
            I have other projects, which aren't related to coding, but might prove useful in more design-oriented positions so I have included them at the end.
            I have been doing digital art for over 10 years now, mostly paintings, the best of which are uploaded to my 
            <a href="https://poparko.artstation.com/"><mark>ArtStation</mark></a>
            page. I have also produced a lab tour video
            for another RWTH institute and a short educational animation about work contracts.
